## Description
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of Premier League winners and top scorers from the 1992–1993 to the 2024–2025 seasons. Using Excel and Power Query, I explored patterns behind title-winning teams and top individual performers to understand trends in team goals, scoring dominance, and title distribution.
The project involved:
- Web scraping historical data from FBref.com directly into Excel using Power Query (From Web).
- Cleaning and transforming the dataset to extract relevant insights.
- Designing interactive dashboards to visualize key trends and comparisons.
The goal was to reveal what really drives a Premier League title win consistent team scoring or individual brilliance — and how these dynamics have evolved over the decades.

## Project Introduction
The English Premier League (EPL) is one of the most competitive football leagues in the world, with clubs and players constantly pushing the limits of performance. But what really defines a championship-winning team? Is it a standout goal scorer or a consistently high-performing squad?
In this project, I explored 33 seasons of Premier League data (1992–2025) to uncover insights into team goal trends, top scorer contributions, and title-winning patterns. Using Excel and Power Query, I collected, cleaned, and visualized data to answer key questions such as:
- How have goal-scoring trends evolved over the decades?
- Do Premier League winners rely more on balanced team efforts or individual brilliance?
- Which clubs have dominated the title race, and how consistent is their success?
- The result is a data-driven story that blends football analytics with powerful Excel visualizations to uncover the factors behind long-term success in the Premier League.

## Aims
The aim of this project is to analyze historical Premier League data to identify the key performance indicators that contribute to winning a league title. Specifically, the project seeks to:
- Understand the relationship between team goals and individual top scorer goals.
- Analyze how goal-scoring trends have evolved across different decades.
- Examine the distribution of league titles among clubs to highlight dominance and competitiveness.
- Create insightful Excel dashboards to visualize and communicate patterns in football performance.
- This analysis helps reveal whether success in the Premier League is driven more by team effort or individual brilliance and how this dynamic has changed over time.

## Methodology
This project followed a structured data analysis workflow using Excel and Power Query. Here’s a breakdown of each step:

1. Data Collection
- Sourced data from FBref.com, a reliable football statistics website.
- Scraped two datasets using Power Query (From Web): Premier League Winners from 1992–1993 to 2024–2025.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., ranking points, competition names) to focus on performance metrics.
- Split combined fields into separate columns: "Team – Goals" ➝ Team and Goals Scored, "Top Scorer – Goals" ➝ Top Scorer and Goals Scored
- Changed data types (e.g., from text to whole number) to enable numerical analysis.
- Created a new column to group seasons by decade: 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.
- Ensured data consistency by correcting naming inconsistencies and handling null values where needed.

3. Data Analysis
- Used Excel tools such as PivotTables, PivotCharts, and formulas to:
- Compare team goals vs top scorer goals over time.
- Summarize total goals by decade.
- Identify highest and lowest goal-scoring seasons.
- Count and visualize club title distributions since 1992.

4. Dashboard Design & Visualization
- Designed interactive Excel dashboards to present findings visually.
- Included charts such as: Line graphs for trends across seasons, Bar charts comparing clubs and top scorers, Slicers and filters for dynamic user interaction.

## Insights 
1.Team Goals vs Top Scorer Goals
Premier League-winning teams consistently outscore the league’s top individual scorers.
 Implication: Titles are typically won by teams with strong overall attacking contributions, not just one standout player.
- Peak goal-scoring seasons by title winners include: 2017–18: 100 goals and 2018–19: 98 goals

- Defensive dominance was more prominent in earlier seasons like 1996–97 and 1998–99, with champions scoring fewer than 80 goals.

2. Top Scorer Goals by Decade
- Gradual rise in top scorer totals from: 1990s: 212 combined goals and 2010s: 264 combined goals

- Sharp drop to 138 goals in the 2020s (up to 2025), which may suggest:
    - Increased use of squad rotation
    - More balanced attacking options
    - Defensively stronger league setups

3. Team Goal Trends

- Most title-winning teams scored between 85–95 goals per season.

- High-scoring period: 2016–2019 with 98–100 goals per season.

- Recent trend: Slight decline in goals, down to 84 goals in 2023–24.

4. Title Distribution
- One club (likely Manchester United) has won 13 titles, showing long-term dominance.

- A small group of clubs have won the majority of titles, indicating:
      - Competitive imbalance
      - Strong club infrastructure, management, and long-term performance consistency

## Recommendations
- Promote balanced goal distribution across multiple players instead of relying on a single top scorer.

- Design tactical systems that enhance team cohesion, movement, and coordinated attacking play.

- Study and adapt to modern defensive and rotational tactics that reduce scoring opportunities.

- Diversify attacking strategies to include contributions from midfielders, full-backs, and set pieces.

- Invest in long-term planning, including managerial stability, data-driven recruitment, and youth development, to reduce overdependence on elite clubs.
